Now Playing is basically an android app which can show you the movies which are currently playing in theaters it uses firebase.In this I've used TMDB API to fetch data. It basically fetches a list of movies which are currently playing in theaters. It also consist of a live chat sections where users can discuss about movies.This feature is similar to the chat that happens on youtube live channels. The app is live so you can check it out.
